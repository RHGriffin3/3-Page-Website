        Will artificial intelligence spell the ultimate end to humanity as we know it?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Artificial intelligence has been a controversial topic ever since the possibility of its existence. The idea of artificial intelligence can even be seen since before computers existed. There are Greek myths of human-like artifacts and machines doing the work of humans. Aristotle is even considered an inventor of AI, creating the first deductive reasoning system, syllogistic logic. Now that artificial intelligence is a real possibility, there is extensive controversy surrounding it. Many people think that intelligent machines have the potential to make our lives easier and make us better humans. But others have fears that those same machines could become smarter than us, potentially turning against humans and taking control. Some believe that AI’s can be designed to do dangerous jobs that risk human lives and even explore places that humans can’t go, but others are afraid that if these machines become intelligent enough, they will grow angry with humans for “enslaving” them and revolt.

        <p>
        Let us analyze the pros of artificial intelligence and robotics. <br>
        The idea of artificial intelligence and robotics is beneficial to human society; essentially it is creating machines that can think for humans. It creates more leisure time alleviating the difficulties faced by mankind. Work would be more efficient and precise leaving less room for human error and many more beneficial instances can be brought up. <br>
        One major barrier that can be broken with AI and robotics is space exploration, mankind has always been barred to duration, and time when space traveling with the limitations of the human body. With robotics, new space discoveries can be made since they have the ability to endure the most extreme environments that comes with interplanetary travel. This groundbreaking advantage could lead to medicinal cures to terminal diseases as well. <br>
        Another major benefit of AI and robotics is that these machines can be programmed to reach Earth’s roughest climates, they can mine for fuel or explore the deepest parts of the oceans. Think of how many lives were lost in the construction of the Hoover Dam, or Empire State Building. It has been stated that for every one million spent on the skyscrapers one man died, with 11 construction workers dying for the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge and a whopping number of 27 people dying for the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. It seems the work is not worth the lives lost. <br>
        Creating AI and robotics that were built to face such harsh difficulties will prevent any human losses and injuries; this in turn will create leisure time or more time solving the other problems humans face with laborious tasks. Another great advantage is the ability of the robotics to work without stopping. These endless benefits beg the question as to what is taking so long for the creation of AI’s and robotics, but the answer lies in other questions as well.

        Keeping this in mind, let us now examine the cons of artificial intelligence and robotics. <br>
        Using artificial intelligence looks great on paper, but there are many disadvantages associated with relying too heavily on artificial intelligence. One fact is that artificial intelligence lacks human characteristics, like emotions, feelings and expressions. Not only do humans physically have a tender compassionate touch, but they also have the ability to express the most extreme emotions like love and hate through gestures and facial expressions. <br>
        Artificial intelligence, essentially, doesn’t have a brain so things like common sense, learned behaviors, and creativity, are foreign concepts. Those concepts define a human and give them unique abilities that otherwise artificial intelligence does not have. With growing dependency for artificial intelligence, human intelligence is weakening. Simple tasks such as cleaning and writing will be replaced by artificial intelligence and we will forget our own human capabilities. <br>
        If we delegate too many tasks we will lose our workforce, unemployment will rise, and we will be raising a nation of helpless and incompetent individuals. We would be at risk of our more intelligent counterparts eventually outsmarting us and asserting dominance over humans. The idea of robots becoming smarter than humans and ruling the world one day is really not that far-fetched and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Relying too heavily on artificial intelligence could be the result of drastic changes within the human race. In the words of Steve Wozniak:
        <q>If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they’ll think faster than us and they’ll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently.</q>
